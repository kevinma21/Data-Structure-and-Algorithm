# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my advanced algorithms projects from the 3rd semester, implemented using C++. It serves as a collection of various data structures and algorithms with well-organized code implementations.

## Contents

- **Array**
  - Basic array operations and implementations using classes.
- **Linked List**
  - Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.
- **Trees**
  - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and AVL Trees.
- **Graphs**
  - Graph traversals and adjacency list/matrix representations.
- **Hashing Techniques**
  - Hash table implementations.
- **Heap**
  - Min-Heap and Max-Heap structures.
- **Sorting Techniques**
  - Common sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Stack and Queue**
  - Implementation of stacks and queues (including circular queues).
- **Sparse and Polynomial Representation**
  - Operations on sparse matrices and polynomial expressions.
- **Tower of Hanoi**
  - Recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- **Fibonacci**
  - Fibonacci sequence generation.
- **nCr Computation**
  - Combination calculation using Pascal's triangle and recursion.
